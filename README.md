## Getting Started

It is recommended that you use the web-version available at https://scigrade.com/ but if you want to download and run the SciGrade locally, it is possible though it requires an internet connection to login and accesses the marking form and student information (exclusive for TA's and admins).

## Known issues

We aim to make the SciGrade as perfect as possible but unfortunately, there may be some unforeseen bugs. If you manage to find one that is not here, feel free to create a [bug report](https://github.com/ASully/SciGrade/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) so we can fix it.
