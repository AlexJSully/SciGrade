SciGrade is an online web-tool that allows students (or any user with access) to mark and assist in gRNA+Primer generation. 

## Getting Started

It is recommended that you use the web-version available at https://scigrade.com/ but if you want to download and run the SciGrade locally, it is possible though it requires an internet connection to login and accesses the marking form and student information (exclusive for TA's and admins).
